# World Weather Analysis
Using the OpenWeatherMap API, I retrieved weather data for randomly generated cities to create a dataframe. Then, based on customer weather preferences, I identified potential vacation locations and nearby hotel options then input those on a generated map. Finally, using the Google Directions API, I created a travel itinerary for four citites from the filtered dataframe.
